# Security Policy

## Overview

OVERRIDE is a simulated operating environment.

It is designed to model system behavior inside an isolated environment and is **not intended to provide real operating-system security or host-system protection**.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are primarily targeted at the latest development version.

| Version        | Supported   |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Latest         | Yes         |
| Older releases | Best effort |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in OVERRIDE, please report it privately rather than publicly disclosing the issue immediately.

When reporting an issue, include:

* A clear description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce it
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Potential impact
* Relevant logs or test cases

Please do not include passwords, private keys, personal information, or other sensitive data in a report.

## What Counts as a Security Issue?

Examples include:

* Unexpected access to privileged operations
* Authentication bypass
* World-isolation failures
* Host filesystem access caused by OVERRIDE
* Recovery package integrity bypass
* Recovery rollback failures
* Unexpected modification of host resources
* Persistent-state corruption caused by untrusted input

## Scope

The following are generally outside the project's security scope:

* Vulnerabilities in Windows itself
* Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
* Issues requiring physical access to the user's machine
* Bugs that only affect the simulated environment without security implications

## Disclosure

Please allow reasonable time for an issue to be investigated and fixed before publicly disclosing exploitation details.

Security fixes may be documented in the changelog and release notes.
